    <h2>Australian dietary guidelines</h2>
    <p>Do you know what foods are best to put on your plate? Or how much you should eat and how often?

The Australian dietary guidelines provide up-to-date advice about the types and recommended number of serves of the different foods that we need to eat for good nutrition and health. These are shown in the Australian guide to healthy eating.

The guidelines are developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, working with independent experts in nutrition. They are based on the best available science about the types and amounts of foods and the dietary patterns that are thought to promote health and wellbeing, and reduce your risk of diet-related conditions and chronic disease.</p>
